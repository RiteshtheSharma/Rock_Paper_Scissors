# Rock_Paper_Scissors
VanillaJs project as odin project assignment https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors 
## How the game works 
-It is based on typical Rock ,Paper and scissors where each player simultaneously forms either a rock (closed fist), paper (open hand), or scissors (hand with index and middle fingers extended), with the outcome being determined by the rules that rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
- In this game user has to click one of 3 buttons as his move and js code will simulteously generate its move using Math.random function
- Each time you press one of the buttons i.e Rock(ü™®) , Paper (üìÑ) and Scissors (‚úÇÔ∏è) the dialog box will show your move
- The game will over only if user wins or looses 5 times so user has to continously give its choice by clicking the button untill the web interface will indicate that the game is over using a dialog
- Number of Wins , Losses and Draws will be displayed along the user and corresponding js code 's moves
- You can restart the game by clicking on a larger button which is enabled only when game overs and remain disabled when is going on
